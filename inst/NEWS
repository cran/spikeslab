RELEASE 1.0.0 is the first and initial release of this package.

Fits a rescaled spike and slab model using a continuous bimodal
prior. Can be used for prediction and variable selection in low and
high-dimensional linear regression models.

Key features include:

o Option for ultra-fast handling of high-dimensional data.
o Variable selection using the generalized elastic net (gnet).
o Grouping of variables with unique regularization (no limit on the number).
o Predict wrapper for predicting on test data.
o Sparse PC approach for multiclass analysis of gene expression data.
o Depends on the randomForest and lars R-packages.
